# Meeting 4 (Notes)

**Chair: Roderick de Britto Heemskerk**

**Secretary: Matthijs Arnoldus**

**Date: 04/03/2019**


##Notes
- We can tell the TA how to run the JavaFX locally, so we do not have to add maven dependency if it does not work out

- TA recommends to install plugins for maven site, but checkstyle is fine

- Coverage report and scrum screenshot are fine

- Create tags every week

- Tests are required, else it cannot be accepted. Not enough tests were in the demo.

- Mockito allows to simulate method calls, so useful for connection tests

- TA will discuss further about how we can use firebase with the instructors

- We are not behind, but we need to try to keep up for the demo in week 6

- In the next TA meetings we need to show what everyone has done

- Branch names are good

- We need to try to keep up with the test coverage

- We decided to add clear descriptions to issues in the scrum board, so everyone understands what everyone is doing
