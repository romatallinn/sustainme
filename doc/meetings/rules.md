# Rules

###### These rules describe the points of action whenever an issue appears within the team members or of the unfavourable behaviour of individuals.

- Democracy Rules

- If you have to miss a meeting or come late, you must notify the team in the chat beforehand. Frequent requests, however, are not allowed unless a good reason is given.

- A missed meeting **without a beforehand notice** or a good reason makes you to sing a karaoke song on a foreign language. The point can also lead to further actions in case of **suspicious** missings on a frequent basis (even if **some** reason is given).

- A late arrival **without a beforehand notice** is forgiven first few times as well as if it is due to a good reason. Following late arrivals will oblige you to bring a cake for the teammates even if a good reason is given.
