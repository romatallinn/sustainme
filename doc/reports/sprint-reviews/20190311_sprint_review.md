# Sprint Review

## Main problems Encountered

### Problem 1: The Exam Week
This week is the exam week. We expect it to be quite until the day of the exam. In order to provide a desired demo next week, we need to work hard after the exam. Special efforts need to be done.

### Problem 2: The Consequences of the Miscommunication with the TA
Last week we got the news that the backend solution we used must be changed. It drugged us back and now we are behind the schedule. The solution is discussed with the TAs.

There is another point that was possibly misunderstood/miscommunicated. It is regarding the Sprint Plans. Previously we were told that they represent the SCRUM board (screenshots). We have now concerns about this. The issue will be also discussed with the TA.


## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - Increased testing effort
    - This week a large part of the JUnit tests were successfully introduced to cover the application. It is not yet on the desired level, but we are on track. The Mockito will be used to cover the rest of the application code.

  - Credentials to "Green API" received
    - Previously we had troubles receiving the access to the APIs that would provide the necessary functionality for the application. We finally have received those.
