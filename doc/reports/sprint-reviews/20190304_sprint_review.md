# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Take up the pace
At this point we are not progressing as fast as expected. 
In order to complete the project we need to make more progress each week.

### Problem 2: Unsure whether we can use firebase for the server-side
Due to the notes given by the TA whether or not the firebase solution will work for our project

### Problem 3: We did not get the response from the carbonfootprint API
We have found a new API which we can use, so we will need to ask permission for using that one.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
 - We improved our test coverage, but we need to make sure that we keep up with testing our methods
 - We started using the SCRUM board efficiently

## Adjustments for next sprint
- We need to start to make some more progress during this week
- We really need to find an API this week or find another method
