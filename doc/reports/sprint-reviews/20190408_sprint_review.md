# Sprint Review

## Main problems encountered

### Problem 1: Presentation and report too long
    - We need to make sure to make both a bit shorter such that they meet the requirements.
### Problem 2: Test coverage not high enough yet
    - Although we have a sufficient test coverage for passing the course, we would like to increase it in order to reach between 90 and 100%.
### Problem 3: We tend to do alle the work in the weekend
    - We should work for in the week and not do everything at the last moment
    
    

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- We have fixed the problem between the tests and the api, we still need to integrate it in all tests.
- We worked more during the week instead of the weekend and spread the work more evenly.
