# sprint review

## Main problems encountered

### Problem 1: Communication regarding demo's
- The change in deadlines was confusing, as we thought we would still be able
    to get the points for week 3 demo. And still think we should.

### Problem 2: Sickness
- Stopped some of us from working efficiently.

## Main good points
- We did our best and made our own assigned deadlines.
- We are really happy about that.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- Earlier personal deadlines
    - Deadline will be on thursday so we have more time to already continue working
