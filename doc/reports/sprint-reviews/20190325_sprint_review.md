# Sprint Review

## Main problems encountered

### Problem 1: Commit messages are not always clear enough
- The commit message doesn't always say what the commit exactly has changed
    - A quick summary would be better

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- Be more clear with what you did
    - A more elaborate commit description so we clearly know what has changed when reading it
