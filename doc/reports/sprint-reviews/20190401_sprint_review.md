# Sprint Review

## Main problems encountered

### Problem 1: Fractal tree did not integrate with javafx
    - Fixed by rewriting the class, so it is now suitable for javafx
### Problem 2: Tests work for a while and then stop working
    - The API does not work well with the authentication part
    
    

## Adjustments from previous sprints
- The commit descriptions have improved, but it can still be better
