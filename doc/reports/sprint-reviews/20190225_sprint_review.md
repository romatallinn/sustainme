Note: Our original sprint review disappeared so we restored it a week later
# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Testing is not done enough
We need to improve our testing, since we did not have enough tests for the demo.

### Problem 2: The SCRUM board is not used well
We need to actively use the SCRUM board so everyone knows who is busy doing what.
Everyone needs to make sure they update SCRUM whenever they have started or completed something.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
Since this is the first sprint review we do not have any adjustments

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Increase testing effort
 - Use the SCRUM board more efficiently
