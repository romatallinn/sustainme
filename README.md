Strong points:

Error: file not found.

Weak points:

Bad at planning, most of the time I'll do things last minute.
Hard to be motivated, studying isn't my favorite thing to do.

Goals:

Trying to become better at programming, also planning.

Reality:

I'm probably behind compared to the others, for now I'm trying the best I can. 
I'll need to learn more Java since I don't think I know enough at the moment

Options:

Working on Java skills.
Motivation and complexity of the stuff we'll need to implement

Will:

I'll work on getting better with programming, also trying to keep up with the material that we use.
I can work on learning Java more, my teammates can help me understand things I don't.
