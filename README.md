Qualities:
Perseverence
	Once I set my mind on something I really want, I keep at this task until I am satisfied.

	
Quick learner
	Generally speaking I can pick up information pretty quickly.

	This will help in a group to help


Flaws:
Easily distracted
	Often when I am working, pretty quickly I start messing around with whatever is on my desk. This stops me from working as effectively as I can.

Dependent
	I feel like I need the approval of others to be sure that my work is done correctly.



Goal:
Working efficiently in a group.
This is important to me as in general I think of myself as pretty messy and distracted. This generally works counterproductive within a group, and I want to tackle that problem as
I feel I have a responsibility to do so for my group. And learning how to work more efficiently will also help me in the future of course. I will have achieved this goal at the
point where I gain consistency in keeping up with deadlines. 

I will actively work on this goal, but this is the first piece of group work we have had until this point, as such I can't say what is going well. What can still use improvement
is my focus on the task at hand.

The main thing that is in my way for reaching this goal is my mentality, up to this point I have not had to put a lot of effort to achieve a number of things, however the reason I
did not put extra effort to do even better, and not procrastinate is because I didn't feel like I had a responsibility towards myself. But as I am working in a group for this project
I will have to mainly realise that, and just focus on my appointed task, and try to bring all my strong suits to the table.

The first step I am taking to reach this goal is formulating this plan, as this already helped me find out where I think the problems lie. As before this point I have not really focused
on whatI really wanted to improve.

Strong points:

Error: file not found.

Weak points:

Bad at planning, most of the time I'll do things last minute.
Hard to be motivated, studying isn't my favorite thing to do.

Goals:

Trying to become better at programming, also planning.

Reality:

I'm probably behind compared to the others, for now I'm trying the best I can. 
I'll need to learn more Java since I don't think I know enough at the moment

Options:

Working on Java skills.
Motivation and complexity of the stuff we'll need to implement

Will:

I'll work on getting better with programming, also trying to keep up with the material that we use.
I can work on learning Java more, my teammates can help me understand things I don't.
