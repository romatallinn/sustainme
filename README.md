## Getting Started

### Installation

##### SSH

```
// Clone this repository with SSH
$ git clone git@gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl:cse1105/2018-2019/oopp-group-70/template.git
```

##### HTTPS

```
// Clone this repository with HTTPS
$ git clone https://gitlab.ewi.tudelft.nl/cse1105/2018-2019/oopp-group-70/template.git
```

### Run

##### Server
First you need to run the server-side application. In order to do this, you need to run the application file `Application.java` located at `src/main/java/server`. This is the entrance point for the server application.

##### Client
Then you can run the client itself. In order to do this, you need to run the application file `ApplicationEntry.java` located at `src/main/java/supporting`. This is the entrance point for the client application.

## Reports

#### Jacoco's Test Coverage:  
Run:
1) `mvn clean` - Optional. Cleans the old data.
2) `mvn test` - generates the raw test coverage data.
3) `mvn jacoco:report` - generates the readable report from the obtained data.

The test coverage reports generated by Jacoco exclude the view package.


#### Checkstyle:  
Run `mvn checkstyle:check`

- Checkstyle configurartion checks the code according to [the Google coding conventions](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn-history/r130/trunk/javaguide.html).

- The configuration itself can be found in [CSE1105.checkstyle.xml](CSE1105.checkstyle.xml).


#### Pipeline:

There is a Gitlabs CI pipeline that contains 3 stages:
- compile: `mvn compiler:compile`
    - Checks if the code is compilable and runnable.
- test: `mvn test -Dcheckstyle.skip`
    - Runs all internal tests.
    - Needs an explicit checkstyle skip, since there is another stage for it.
- checkstyle: `mvn checkstyle:check`
    - Runs the checkstyle configuration.

The pipeline status of the master branch is reflected in a badge, informing if it has passed or failed. There is also another badge that parses the data from test stage of the master to display the test coverage percentage right away.
